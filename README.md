- **GitHub**.
- **Commitizen**.
- **Commitlint**.
- **Conventional Commits**.
- **Husky & Lint Staged**.
- **GitHub Actions**.
- **Semantic Release**.
- **PNPM**.
- **CodeQL**.
- **EditorConfig**.
- **ESLint**.
- **Remark**.
- **Prettier**.
- **Vitest**.

> \[!TIP]
> **A good solution for your business!**
>
> Now you don't have to worry about unnecessary costs.
> Everything is already set up and prepared for you!
>
> And also the template is very good for teams,
> because you can easily standardize projects with this template.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Repository**: Use this template
   to create a new repository on GitHub.

   > Since this is a **Public Template** you can click the button
   > **Use this template** for a faster and more convenient cloning.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your new repository to your local machine.

1. **Start Development**: Develop your project,
   making changes according to your project's needs.

1. **Configure GitHub Actions**: Modify GitHub Actions
   settings to fit your requirements.

   > **For those unfamiliar with GitHub Actions**,
   > our workflows use
   > [**chain**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run),
   > if you want to add more workflows to this chain,
   > workflows, it won't work, because the chain only supports
   > only three levels, example: `workflow A` > `workflow B` >
   > `workflow C` > `workflow D`, if you add `workflow E`
   > to the chain. it won't work!

## Features

- **Flexibility**: Easily customizable template to adapt
  to different project types.

- **Git and GitHub Integration**: Pre-configured `.gitignore`, `.gitmodules`
  and `.gitattributes` for efficient work with Git and GitHub.

  - **Conventional Commits, Commitlint & Commitizen**: If you don't want
    to think about how to write a commit every time,
    these plugins will help you.

    > It will be especially useful for teams that
    > have an ongoing debate about writing commits.

  - **Husky & Lint Staged**: Won't let you submit
    bad code to the repository!

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Built-in CI support using GitHub Actions
  for automatic linting, testing and building of your code with each change.

  > Also suitable for private repositories! GitHub Actions use
  > **cache**, **timeout-minutes**, **path filters** and **workflow run**
  > to reduce the execution time, which means it will significantly
  > reduce your costs!

  - **Security**: Included **CodeQL** workflow for detecting
    and preventing potential vulnerabilities in your code.

  - **Linters**: Help you maintain a consistent code writing style
    and find errors.

  - **Specs**: Automated testing will help you focus on
    writing better code!

  - **Semantic Release**: For those who are tired of writing changelogs
    and thinking about what the next version number will be.

    > If you have **Branch and Tag Protection** rules configured,
    > please read this [article](https://gonzalohirsch.com/blog/semantic-release-and-branch-protection-rules).

- **TypeScript**: Pre-configured **TypeScript** setup
  for improved reliability and development convenience.

- **Bots**:

  - **Dependabot**: No more wasting time updating dependencies!
